# RAlgorithms
A collaborative project by Clara-Christina Gerstner and myself to attempt creating a repertoire of algorithms fully implemented in the R language. Most of these algorithms have built-in versions so are not recommended for actual analyses. They are, however, useful for gaining intuition into code.
